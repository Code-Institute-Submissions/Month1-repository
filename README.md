Technologies used

Web Template from Wix.com, Bootstrap, CSS3, JavaScript, HTML5.

About this project

I have a brother who recently opened up his own barber shop (as named above) and did this site to help him get his brand out to the local market place and to allow people to be able to contact him and make appointments

Discoveries/functionality

This allows my brother to have have a web presence other than on social media, it will allow him to have appointments made online and also show case his work through the portfolio section of the site

Issues/Obstacles The main issues i found with this site was taking a template i got for free on wix and making it bend to what i wanted it to do and look like the main issues where with bootstrap and css, being my very first attempt to do this I also had issues with the carousel and adding hover over links to my brothers facbook site and Linkedin site on his profile picture in the About Section. Also getting the Google map working for the first time was challenging
